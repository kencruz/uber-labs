## Getting Started

1. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - DB_USER: `labber` 
  - DB_PASS: `labber` 
  - DB_NAME: `midterm`
  - SESSION_NAME: `session`
  - SESSION_KEY: `anystringisokay`
  - SESSION_KEY2: `anystringisokay`
  - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: `YOUR_TWILIO_SID`
  - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: `YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  - MY_PHONE: `YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER`
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
4. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
5. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
6. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
